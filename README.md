# PixelRush

This is an exclusiv 3DS homebrew game
It's kinda hard to describe what you have to do in the game butverything you need to know is explained ingame.

The main inspiration was the android game VoxelRush 3D, wich is also pretty cool.

The game features two (two!) gamemodes, a super fast action gameplay, fancy colors, and you can actually save your highscore if you quit the game using the "Quit Game" button in the menu.

Differences between the two gamemodes:
In Classic mode you have random events every 45 seconds for 15 secs. You can use a boost for a short time and also there are items to collect (lives, shield & boost).
In Clean mode you don't have these features
